            </h3>
            <p>One of the greatest ironies is that the only time you want to move a vehicle is when it won't start. A car, truck, or any other sort of vehicle that no longer runs is merely taking up room in your garage or driveway until it is fixed or removed, and its appearance isn't helping matters. You'd probably give everything to have that old hunk of junk removed from your life and property for good — or at least until you can get it working again. Unfortunately, if it doesn't run, that's easier said than done. Rapid Auto can assist you if you have a non-functional vehicle taking up space on your property and are unsure what to do with it. We provide inoperable vehicle transportation services to get that old heap moved or out of your life forever. Rapid Auto is the place to go if you're looking for low-cost salvage car transportation.</p>

            <h3 class="sub-heading">COMPLETE COVERAGE BY INSURANCE
            </h3>
            <p>Insurance is required, especially if you're exporting a high-value vehicle. Most of the time, the insurance that is included in the contained auto shipment cost is insufficient. Auto carriers are required by law to carry property damage insurance coverage. The built-in coverage limits, on the other hand, may not provide further protection for uncommon and pricey vehicles. As a result, we provide gap insurance, which is a supplement to normal insurance that provides more comprehensive coverage based on the car's worth. Every quote we provide for enclosed car shipment includes insurance. During your door-to-door automobile delivery service, your vehicle is completely insured, giving you complete peace of mind. You won't have to pay anything more because insurance is included in our rates.</p>
